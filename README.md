# Summary
  For an actual ice cream and surf shop, I think the business would be sustainable all year long. Because Oahu is in Hawaii, the weather there is majority warm and sunny with water on all sides, prime for beach and surf weather. An added bonus of an ice cream shop would be ideal. The only true concern I see in the data would be the lowest Low in December was 8 degrees colder than the lowest in June, which honestly is not that vast difference. 

  Now, to further the data and provide a more in-depth analysis on weather, humidity and rain fall should factor into the data. As this surf and ice cream shop will basically be dependent on weather. It would also be wise to gather that sort of data from at least 10yrs to find patterns and trends to further cement the results for a weather analysis of a future business.
